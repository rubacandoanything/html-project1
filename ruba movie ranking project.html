<h1>BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO RUBA</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>INCEPTION</h3>
<p>Watching this movie was like going on a mind-blowing mind bender, right from the start.<br>
The overarching concept of implanting a thought or idea into someone mind and having things transgress from there was very intriguing.<br>
I like the exploration of dreams and the different levels of dreams and questioning and bending of reality.

<h3>JOHN WICK FRANCHISE</h3>
<p>A must watch action fick with abundance of assassinations.</p>

<h3>THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL</h3>
<p>It is one of the most beautiful piece of cinema created.</p></body></html>
